This is a scratchpad of sorts for me to resharpen my skills in bare metal embedded programming. No promises about how pretty this code it, but I hope it will become so (and keep its functionality.)

My main goals are to be able to run basic arduino sketches using just C (and some headers...) and compile it with Cmake and flash using the terminal. Wish me luck!
